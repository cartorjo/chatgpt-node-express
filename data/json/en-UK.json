It also offers a greater degree of security, allowing users who are registered as T-mobilitat customers to recover their fare options in the event of loss or theft. It improves the process of acquiring fare options for users entitled to a discount, since once their entitlement has been accredited and the personalised PVC has been acquired, they can recharge the fare options independently (while their entitlement is valid) and through various channels. There is also a wide range of channels for managing support and digitalisation of the service, allowing the customer to anticipate and manage tickets and/or support through digital channels without the need to go specifically to the automatic machine before accessing transport. Finally, the customer will be able to recharge tickets automatically without having to keep an eye on whether their T-casual has already run out, and receive balance alerts on their mobile phone."
