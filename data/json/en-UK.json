A numerical code (PIN) will appear until the user brings their card close to the NFC reader. If this option fails, the user can activate their card at a vending machine by entering the activation PIN shown on their TMB App before the second reading. If this option fails, the agent (telephone or digital) must send the PIN via TPW Agent. He has to check the identity of the customer (ID card, first and last name and date of birth have to be requested). The agent accesses the TPW Agent client file. In the "Supports" section, the user's card will appear. At the support container, the option "Send activation PIN" appears. The user will receive an email (provided that the notifications have been activated). At the vending machine, the user has to bring the card close to the reader and enter the PIN number received. If this option fails, the agent must tell the user that they can obtain the activation PIN by accessing their personal space on the TMB website (provided they are linked to JoTMBé). Here the user cannot activate the PIN, but can obtain it to activate it from a vending machine. The user accesses the "Supports" section; select "How to activate". The PIN will be displayed on the screen and the user is offered to send it by mail. At the vending machine, the user has to hold the card up to the reader and enter the PIN number received.

In the event that he/she enters the identifying document number, he/she will have to select the support to be duplicated from among all those registered in the user's file. It is possible that the support cancellation status is 'executing', if so, proceed in the same way as if it were executed. The support information is recovered and a new support is issued with the same information that is available on the original support. In the case of lost or stolen support (support not delivered by the customer) or if the support is out of warranty, the exchange has an associated cost (it is a duplicate) and the new support will have a renewed warranty. In this case, the title that will be instantiated in the new support, will be instantiated in the conditions in which the title was when the support was blocked; if it had not been blocked, it will be instantiated in the conditions in which it was at that moment. Payment for the duplicate is made using the available means of payment (card). Through the process of issuing a duplicate (due to loss or theft), in the PEC, the cancellation of the lost or stolen support is automatically included. The agent, however, does have to check that the lost or stolen support has indeed been deregistered (in isolation, it can happen that the PEC fails and does not deregister it). The agent has to access TPW Agent > Supports, and click on 'Support deregistration request' in case it has not been deregistered correctly".

      "answer": "1. Ask for the customer's details to identify him/her to TPW. Verify to TPW Agent that the customer has completed the transaction and has been charged. 3. If everything matches the information provided by the client and the title is not validated:- If the purchase is from a DA or face-to-face channel, bank details are requested to make the transfer: the client has to fill in the bank transfer form that is sent to them (the signature and stamp of the bank is not necessary). Backoffice sends the technical report of the QRS and the transfer sheet to the Treasury (they will provide us with the corresponding contacts) once a week (normally on Mondays). If the ticket has to be extracted and/or the purchase is via the Web or App channel, Billetatge (they will provide us with the corresponding contacts) is asked to extract and/or return the ticket that is the object of the claim-return. In the Unified Returns Excel, shared by the OAE and Billetatge, the Zendesk ticket number, the date of the QRS, the date of entry in the Excel, the sales order if it is an App or Web purchase (if it is a purchase from DA or Kiosk, "no sales order, purchase from DA [or] Kiosk" is entered), if it is T-mobilitat (the Excel applies to all online purchases, whether or not they are T-mobilitat), the amount to be returned (if it is only a withdrawal, "Withdrawal" is noted), the reason ("Return on customer request"), the support number, the title identifier code and the date of the charge. Billetatge makes these returns and withdrawals every two days. Canal digital can also make this type of extractions and returns, although before Billetatge returns them, they must be checked by the Backoffice team. In the case of a title purchase by cardboard support, the customer must be referred to the point where the title is extracted. This operation must be noted in the Excel spreadsheet of incidents of Points. When the withdrawal has been made, the Point agent will send an e-mail to the QRS management unit to proceed with the refund of the amount".

If no more than 24 hours have passed and the title has not been validated, when the customer clicks on the three dots, a drop-down menu will appear with the option "Request refund". If the operation is successful, the refund will be made through the credit card used at the time of purchase of the title. The refund involves generating a deferred action to cancel the recharge of the selected support and title in the case of the web/app (without NFC).

It is analysed if an involuntary double validation has really occurred by consulting the operation history of the support concerned, where it can be verified that two consecutive validations appear with a small time interval between the two validations (Customer detail > Supports > Title detail > Title movement history).2. If the agent verifies that the double validation has been involuntary, he/she accesses the retail of the ticket where the trip reimbursement operation is made (Customer detail > Supports > Ticket detail).3. If the "Regularisation of trips" button is enabled, click on the button and inform the number of trips to be restored in the pop-up window. If an unintentional double validation has occurred twice, the agent can restore the two trips (or the corresponding ones). Click "Confirm" to complete the request. Request generated: when confirming the action, a request for regularisation of trips is generated and processed within a maximum of 20 minutes, as this is a deferred action (the customer must be informed that he/she has to make a reading of the support). At the same time, a notification is sent to the channels configured by the customer (in case he has configured at least 1) informing that the request for regularisation of trips has been generated. If the button "Regularisation of trips" is disabled, it means that the refund cannot be made in this title. This operation will only be available in case the ticket is trip-based and does not have the feature to set the zone in first validation (T-casual, T-family, etc.). In addition, none of the following conditions have to be fulfilled:- There is already a pending trip restitution request, another one cannot be made before executing the previous one.- If there is a pending load request.- Support inactive.- Support cancelled or pending cancellation.- Support blocked or pending blocking.- Title blocked or pending blocking.- Title that has exceeded the maximum value that the field can contain in the ATIU (127 trips)".

      "answer": "1. Search for the TPW customer from the ID card or support number. Once he has accessed the profile, he has to click on the tab 'Complete invoices'. The agent selects 'Generate invoice' (top right) and the search engine has to set some search criteria: simplified invoice number, support number, time range of the simplified invoices (limit of 2 months for the search). Once the search criteria have been indicated, select 'Search'. From the list of simplified invoices that appear according to the search criteria, the agent has to select the ones he/she wishes to make a complete invoice. Once selected (click on the white box on the right), click on 'Add invoices' on the bottom left. You have to take into account that:- If a selected simplified invoice has an associated amendment, these will also be added.- You can only incorporate simplified invoices that are not yet part of another complete invoice.- If a simplified invoice has been removed from a complete invoice, they can be incorporated into a new complete invoice.- You can only make complete invoices for ATM integrated products, not for non-integrated purchases.4. Once the invoices have been added, a box appears at the bottom. With this item, the agent can delete simplified invoices selected by mistake. If you want to incorporate invoices that were not included in the first search, the agent can change the search parameters and add new ones. Once with all the simplified invoices that are to be grouped, the agent has to complete the receiver's data, which will appear on the invoice. Finally, click on 'Create complete invoice', and confirm the operation. The e-mail is an editable field of the receiver's data, but it is not printed on the invoice. With the full invoice created (they all start with the number 3), the agent can send it (to the e-mail address in the T-mobilitat client file) or download it (to print it). When generating a complete invoice, it will no longer be possible to work with the simplified invoices incorporated. You can go to the 'Invoices' section, but the options for downloading or sending will be disabled".

      "question": "T-mobilitat: How can I consult a complete invoice and generate a duplicate or a copy?",
      "answer": "1. Search for the customer at TPW from the ID card or support number, and access the 'Complete invoices' tab. In the search engine, the agent can search by invoice number, associated support or a time interval (maximum two months). Once the search is done, the complete invoices that meet the specified parameters are displayed. With this query, the agent can download a duplicate or a copy. If a completed invoice has not yet been sent, the option to send will still appear. If it has been sent previously, the options to send or download 'duplicate' and download 'copy' will appear.

When the complete invoice is opened, on the top right hand side, he will select the tab 'Complete invoice rectification'.3. The process is the same as the one explained for generating a complete invoice. In this case, you can add or delete invoices, or modify the receiver's details. When a simplified invoice is associated to a full invoice, when a return is made, a simplified invoice is produced as a rectification, but also, automatically, a full rectification invoice. When the appropriate changes have been made, the agent selects 'modify full invoice', and the one generated will replace the previous one. Complete amending invoices start with the number 4".

      "answer": "Generally, it occurs when a user loses or has his PVC card stolen, requests the blocking of the title or support, and subsequently requests a duplicate card from Puntos. It should be understood that a blocking request is a deferred order that is executed (after 60 minutes) when the card interacts with a cCTIU reader. If the lost or stolen card has not interacted with a cCTIU, the card will not be blocked. Therefore, when a duplicate support is issued, through the PEC, all the information contained in the original is copied: profiles, titles and pending requests (such as blocking).\It is possible that, despite the fact that the customer service agent makes the duplicate card interact with the PEC reader, the blocking takes a few minutes or hours to be executed, and is executed once the customer has validated. Occasionally, however, the information from this blocking (whether executed or not) is not reflected in the customer's TPW account. Therefore, TPW cannot request the unblocking from TPW".
